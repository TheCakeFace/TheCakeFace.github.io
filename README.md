# CakeFace Minecraft

CakeFace is a gaming community formed in 2014 that was mainly focused on a Minecraft server. The primarily factions-based server ran on-and-off until it shut down in 2017.

While the original server is down, we still have a [Discord](https://discord.gg/Z4aKfxR) chat going if you want to hang out.

## FAQ

### Do you plan on bringing the Minecraft server back?
The Minecraft server started out as a hobby that I eventually got bored of, so if it becomes entertaining to me again and there is enough demand I will consider it.

### What happened to the forums, website, etc.?
I've got a backup made of the old forum/website, but probably won't be re-hosting it any time soon.

### Do you still have the old maps from the MC server?
Yes, though I do not plan on giving a download yet.
